## Backend (PANdemic SIMulation)

You can find the backend in `src/simulation`.

How do I use it? For now, just run

```
$ python src/pansim/pansim
```

You can find some example outputs in the `data` directory.

There are still many things to do:
- Reimplement in more efficient language
- Implement various groups and group sizes (Household, Families, Neighbourhoods, Cities, ...)
- Use concurrency
- Implement behaviour changes
- ...
